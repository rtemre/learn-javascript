// The problem involves JavaScript this behavior, especially
// how this works in regular functions vs arrow functions, and method chaining.

class a {
  log() {
    console.log("a");
    function x() {
      return this;
    }
    return x();
  }

  logger() {
    console.log("b");
    const f = () => {
      return this;
    };
    return f();
  }
}

// log():
// Logs "a".
// Declares a regular function x() inside it.
// x() returns this.
// Important: Regular functions have their own this binding. If not called as a method of an object, this will be:
// undefined in strict mode (which ES6 classes are by default).
// The global object in non-strict mode (browser: window).

// logger():
// Logs "b".
// Declares an arrow function f inside it.
// f returns this.
// Arrow functions do NOT have their own this, they capture the this from the surrounding lexical scope.
// Here, the surrounding scope is logger(), which is called on the instance of the class (x), so this = instance of a.
// Returns f(), which returns the instance, enabling method chaining.

let x = new a();
x.logger().logger().log(); // b b a
x.log().log().log().log(); // undefined.log()
// TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'log')
